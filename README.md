The Gates - Spirit Carving üéÉ
A full-stack, Halloween-themed user authentication system built with Firebase and Vanilla JavaScript.
Welcome to The Gates! This project is a complete, single-page web application that provides a full user authentication and profile management experience, all wrapped in an immersive and spooky Halloween theme.


‚ú® Features
This application demonstrates a full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) user cycle with modern, professional features.

User Authentication: Secure user signup and login using Firebase Authentication (Email & Password).

Forgot Password: "Lost your spirit?" functionality to send password reset emails.

Client-Side Validation: Robust, real-time checks for valid email formats and password strength.

Real-Time Profile Management: A dedicated profile page ("The Crypt") where users can update their bio and see changes reflected instantly without a page refresh, thanks to Firestore's real-time listener.

Optimized Image Uploads: Users can upload a profile picture ("Apparition"). The image is resized and compressed on the client-side before being uploaded to Firebase Storage for a fast and efficient experience.

Responsive & Thematic UI/UX: A mobile-first, dark-mode design with custom fonts, spooky animations, and a cohesive Halloween theme built with Tailwind CSS.
